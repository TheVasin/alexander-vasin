Everybody wants to read more.\nWe all know it is very important for us to read actual books instead of web articles and facebook feed. But it always seems there is not enough time for books. Where should one find an hour or so to read a book if he struggles to find time even for a cup of tea?\nI thought this way all of the time until Apple introduced screen time feature to iOs. Then I found I spend two hours a day in front of my phone, and that's even after I ditched Instagram from my phone and set a time limit for twitter.\nMy weekly social networking time is 7 hours. What am I doing there for 7 hours? That's a lot of time! I could redirect it to reading books. Of course, some of that time is spent on a toilet seat, but even there you could read a book rather than scrolling infinity facebook feed.\nMy advice for everybody who is struggling to read more books:\n Remove most of the social networking apps from your phone, so you don't have quick access to them. Set limits for the ones that you decided to keep. Every time you reach for a phone to grab, either resist the urge and get a book instead or start reading from an application. When your phone says it's enough, don't snooze the alarm, get a book. When it starts to work, make limits a little bit smaller.  Voila! You have several hours a week for books. We don't even realize how much time we spend on those social networks that specially designed this way, so we keep scrolling on and on.\nKeeping your books on a separate device or even on paper makes it easier. If you are reading from your phone you could slip to opening messaging application or news feed.\nWe all love memes and kittens, but let's face it - they don't make us smarter. So let's keep that kitten-time limited and spend some of it for reading books. Then you can enjoy your kittens and be both intelligent and happy.\n","date":1575504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575504000,"objectID":"6fe59bb000bb935753230fdaebc1d9f8","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/time-to-read/","publishdate":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/time-to-read/","section":"post","summary":"I always wanted to read more.

It is being used every day by lots of people around the world and every one of them uses it in a slightly different manner. Many different tasks can be completed using Excel. I personally believe that Excel is the best Microsoft product.\nIn my everyday job, I use Excel for several tasks. Of course, there is reporting tasks when I am preparing performance graphs or finding thin places in huge amounts of data. Also, I use excel when fulfilling my system administrator's task. In this article, I want to share some useful tips that help me every day.\nImagine that you need to provide a list of user's databases to HR so they can clean it up. This is a pretty simple task. In Windows open command prompt, go do directory which contains databases and enter\ndir /b \u0026gt; databases.csv \u0026ldquo;/b\u0026rdquo; option needs to eliminate unnecessary information in the resulting file. In Linux, it is even simpler. Just type in\nls \u0026gt; databases.csv and that is it. This will populate the file with filenames in the directory. You can then open in Excel, do whatever you want and send it to the HR department.\nNow imagine that your file was processed and you have 100 records selected for removal. Some of the people would remove it by hands and be Ok with it. I would like to automate this task a little. There is no need to install additional software for this. We will use only Excel and the command prompt. Filter your result the way you can see only files that need to be removed. Next to the column with filenames type in this formula:\nCONCATENATE(\u0026quot;DEL /F /Q\u0026quot;; A1) This way you get command for quiet deletion of the file as a result. In Linux, I would use this command.\nrm -f Then expand column \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; and you will get the desired command for every file from the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; column.\nLooks great! All you need to do is to open a command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains these files and copy-paste column \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; to command prompt. Every command from the column will be performed one by one and all the required files will be removed.\nThis is a good way to save some time. You can automate many routine tasks this way. Instead of delete command, you can create files, rename them, copy. You can do the same trick with directories. All you need to do is to take your list and concatenate it with the right command that will perform a quiet operation.\nBe careful with this as you may accidentally do something you would not want. It is good to create a test environment and try it out there.\nP.S. BTW, for this article, I used http://listofrandomnames.com to create a list of random names. Then I created files the same way described in this article. This is a great solution for testing your batch commands.

This time I spend a week in New York only. This city is extra ordinal. It is huge in so many aspects. It has so many things to love as well as a lot of things to hate. I really enjoyed my stay.\nI would like to share some places that I liked and of course some photos.\nHighline Park is a great example of how to turn something old and ugly into beautiful thing. The park is built on abandoned railroad. It is nice place to have a walk or relax. I walked through all of it in early morning and enjoyed great view of the city and some fresh air.\n   Nice View from top of the Rock   If you are going to climb Empire State Building consider Top of the Rock on the Rockefeller Center as replacement. Not that it is better than ESB but it has different experience. First of all you are going to see ESB itself and Central Park from good perspective.\nSecond thing is that the Top of the rock is not so high. It might look as a lack but it turns out as advantage. The surrounding buildings look more impressive from Top of the Rock because you are closer to them.\nAnd the third advantage is that the lines are much shorter comparing to Empire State Building so you will go there much faster, especially if you booked it online in advance. At the end of the day I recommend climbing on to both of the observation decks - they provide gorgeous views.\nAmerican Museum of Natural History is absolutely fantastic! We have not so many good science museums here in Russia so I was amazed. My personal favorites are Hayden Planetarium and IMAX movie. Plan in advance as you might spend there whole day. So many things are there.\n   Central Park squirrel   Central Park is one of the most popular places in New York. Go there in the early morning. At this time air is cooler and fresher and the park will not be overcrowded. If you like animals then aim for squirrels. There are a lot of them. Mostly they are very friendly and available for a contact if you have some peanuts.\nI always add great places to eat to my trip plan. This time I visited several places and here are the best of them. Eileen's Special Cheesecake is a must visit place for everyone who loves desserts. This small bakery located at 17 Cleveland Place. You can eat there, take away and even order cheesecakes to your home. Their cheesecakes are piece of art. I hope someday I will learn to bake cheesecake tasting like those I tried at Eileen's.\nPete Luger Steak House is another place I very recommend. This restaurant is located on 178 Broadway, Brooklyn and provides the most amazing steaks I have ever tried. There is nothing to add to it. Love steaks? Go to Peter Luger.\nHere is some photos from my both trips to USA.
