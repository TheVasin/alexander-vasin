I love traveling and food. A rare person doesn't like these two, right?

At the intersection of these my two passions I love eating while I am traveling. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy visiting new places and learning something new about them. In fact, I often conduct cultural research before I am headed somewhere. But I get bored pretty quickly with people that try
to watch every other sculpture that foreign country may provide. I do not mind sightseeing at all and there are many beautiful things to see in any country.

But.

Pretty often there is a local food that has a very rich history too. For example, the history of Czech beer is older than the history of many famous Czech buildings. Any country can share some food features.

Like architecture, local food can be affected by other cultures. Some time ago there was no potato in Russia. Now one can not imagine Russian cousin without a potato.

People eat every day. In most countries. Next time you will be abroad, try a taste of local culture.
