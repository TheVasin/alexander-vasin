I have been dreaming about my own blog since I had my first PC. Those times the internet in Russia was pretty bad. There was only one dial-up provider in my town, and the prices were huge. In fact, it was billed per minute of usage. I had to disconnect every time the page was loaded so I could read it in peace without worrying about money.
I never felt neither I had enough things to tell about, nor my English level was proficient enough. I tried to create my own web sites though they were pretty basic.
It changed a lot since then. I learned English a bit. I started to gain my technical skills and develop my career in IT. Now it seems like I can afford a little blog of mine.

We'll see how it goes.
