Recently I went to USA for a second time. This time I spend a week in New York only. This city is extra ordinal. It is huge in so many aspects. It has so many things to love as well as a lot of things to hate. I really enjoyed my stay.

I would like to share some places that I liked and of course some photos.  

**Highline Park** is a great example of how to turn something old and ugly into beautiful thing. The park is built on abandoned railroad. It is nice place to have a walk or relax. I walked through all of it in early morning and enjoyed great view of the city and some fresh air.

If you are going to climb Empire State Building consider **Top of the Rock** on the Rockefeller Center as replacement. Not that it is better than ESB but it has different experience. First of all you are going to see ESB itself and Central Park from good perspective.  

Second thing is that the Top of the rock is not so high. It might look as a lack but it turns out as advantage. The surrounding buildings look more impressive from Top of the Rock because you are closer to them.

And the third advantage is that the lines are much shorter comparing to Empire State Building so you will go there much faster, especially if you booked it online in advance. At the end of the day I recommend climbing on to both of the observation decks - they provide gorgeous views.  

**American Museum of Natural History** is absolutely fantastic! We have not so many good science museums here in Russia so I was amazed. My personal favorites are Hayden Planetarium and IMAX movie. Plan in advance as you might spend there whole day. So many things are there.

**Central Park** is one of the most popular places in New York. Go there in the early morning. At this time air is cooler and fresher and the park will not be overcrowded. If you like animals then aim for squirrels. There are a lot of them. Mostly they are very friendly and available for a contact if you have some peanuts.  

I always add great places to eat to my trip plan. This time I visited several places and here are the best of them. **Eileen's Special Cheesecake** is a must visit place for everyone who loves desserts. This small bakery located at 17 Cleveland Place. You can eat there, take away and even order cheesecakes to your home. Their cheesecakes are piece of art. I hope someday I will learn to bake cheesecake tasting like those I tried at Eileen's.  

**Pete Luger Steak House** is another place I very recommend. This restaurant is located on 178 Broadway, Brooklyn and provides the most amazing steaks I have ever tried. There is nothing to add to it. Love steaks? Go to Peter Luger.  

Here is some photos from my both trips to USA. Hope you will find some time to take a look.
