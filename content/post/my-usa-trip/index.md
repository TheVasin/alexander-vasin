Hello!

I just got back from my trip to the USA. It was an amazing experience. We traveled through 13 states from east to west. The amount of things I saw in these two weeks is huge. Every day was a trip by itself. I can not wait to share my photos.

By now I have created a map with all the main stops we had by the way from New York to San Francisco.

I hope you will like it.
